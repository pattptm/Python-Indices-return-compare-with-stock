# Python-Indices-return-compare-with-stock
This python code divided in two part. First codes perform Indices return of four indices (^gspc=S&P500,^ixic=NASDAQ,^gdaxi=GermanDax,^ftse=FTSE) to see the move ment of return from 1997 until 2021. The second part I pick my favorite stock (AMZN= amazon) to compare with 2 big indices (^gspc=S&P500 and ^Dji=Downjones) to see the movement of return and found out that over 20 years Amazon stock price has performed better than others company in the market (Benchmark). Very interesting research. Stay tunned for the next chapter of my coding
